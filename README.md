# Purchase-Behavior-Analysis
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of user purchase behavior, from time-to-conversion and re-engagement patterns to funnel performance and revenue segmentation. It combines data extraction, transformation, and visualization to uncover actionable business insights.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**  
  Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key business metrics like time to purchase, re-engagement intervals, funnel drop-offs, revenue by region, and more.
- **BigQuery**  
  Used for scalable and efficient SQL querying of large event datasets. Enabled advanced analysis like session duration, user-level aggregation, and funnel segmentation.

## 📁 Key Dashboards & Visuals

### 1. **Purchase Timing & Conversion**
- Avg time to purchase (per user per session)
- Time-to-purchase trends over time
- Min/max conversion delay

### 2. **Re-engagement Analysis**
- Re-purchase intervals (0-day, 1–7 days, etc.)

### 3. **Funnel Performance**
- Drop-off at each funnel stage
- Conversion rate insights (from page view to purchase)

### 4. **Revenue Analysis**
- Top revenue-generating users
- Revenue distribution by country
- Daily total quantity trends

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Identified key drop-off points in user funnel (e.g., high bounce after view_item stage).
- Quantified same-day repeat purchases and their behavioral implications.
- Segmented and visualized revenue by top customers and geographies.
- Created actionable recommendations based on volatility, funnel efficiency, and timing metrics.

## 📈 Recommended Next Steps

- Add RFM segmentation.
- Cohort Analysis	Measure how different user cohorts behave over time
